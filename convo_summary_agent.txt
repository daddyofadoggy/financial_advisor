═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 2. RECOMMENDED STRATEGIES ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TOP STRATEGY #1: Sector Leader Momentum
	•	Description: This strategy aims to capitalize on AAPL's strong uptrend and market leadership by entering on controlled pullbacks or confirmed breakouts.
	•	Risk Level: Medium
TOP STRATEGY #2: Value-Oriented Entry Strategy
	•	Description: This patient strategy focuses on acquiring AAPL shares at a more favorable valuation, waiting for a market-driven price correction of 10-15%.
	•	Risk Level: Low-to-Medium
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 3. EXECUTION PLAN ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
	•	Entry Strategy: Use Limit Orders for value entries and Stop-Limit Orders for breakout entries. Risk no more than 1% of total portfolio value on a single trade.
	•	Risk Management: Move stop-loss to breakeven after a 1:1 risk-reward gain. Use a trailing stop to lock in profits on a long-term hold.
	•	Profit-Taking: Consider selling partial positions at pre-defined profit targets (e.g., 2x or 3x the initial risk) to de-risk the trade.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 4. RISK ASSESSMENT ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Comparative Risk Analysis: Strategy #1 (Momentum) carries higher volatility and market risk, while Strategy #2 (Value-Entry) has lower market risk but higher opportunity cost risk (cash drag).
Key Risks to Monitor:
	1	Valuation Risk: AAPL's high P/E ratio makes it vulnerable to a correction.
	2	Opportunity Cost: The value strategy risks missing gains if the stock doesn't pull back.
	3	Momentum Reversal: The momentum strategy is vulnerable to a market downturn.
Risk-Adjusted Recommendation: Strategy #2 (Value-Oriented Entry) is recommended as it aligns better with a moderate risk profile, prioritizing capital preservation.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 5. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Recommended Action: Proceed with a hybrid approach:
	1	Initial Allocation: Deploy 25-30% of your intended capital into AAPL now, using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach over the next 3 months.
	2	Set Value-Entry Orders: Place Good 'Til Canceled (GTC) Limit Orders for the remaining 70-75% of capital at tiered levels corresponding to a 10% and 15% correction from the peak.
